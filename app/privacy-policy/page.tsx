                rights. This section explains your rights and some of our
                responsibilities to help you. You can get an electronic or
                paper copy of your medical record:

                You can ask to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your

              <p>
                We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information.
                We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee.
              </p>

              <h4>ASK US TO CORRECT YOUR MEDICAL RECORD</h4>
              <p>
                You can ask us to correct health information about you that you
                think is incorrect or incomplete. Ask us how to do this.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to your request, but we&rsquo;ll

              </p>
              <p>We will say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to all reasonable requests.</p>

              <h4>ASK US TO LIMIT WHAT WE USE OR SHARE</h4>

                You can ask us not to use or share certain health information
                for treatment, payment, or our operations. We are not required
                to agree to your request, and we may say &ldquo;no&rdquo; if it
                would affect your care.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you pay for a service or health care item out-of-pocket in
                full, you can ask us not to share that information for the
                purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer.
                We will say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; unless a law requires us to share
                that information.
              </p>

              <h4>GET A LIST OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE&rsquo;VE SHARED INFORMATION</h4>

                you ask, who we shared it with, and why.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will include all the disclosures except for those about
                treatment, payment, and health care operations, and certain
                other disclosures (such as any you asked us to make).
                We&rsquo;ll provide one accounting a year for free but will
                charge a reasonable, cost-based fee if you ask for another one
                within 12 months.

                rights and make choices about your health information.

                For certain health information, you can tell us your choices
                about what we share. If you have a clear preference for how we
                share your information in the situations described below, talk
                to us. Tell us what you want us to do, and we will follow your
                instructions. In these cases, you have both the right and
                choice to tell us to:

                If you are not able to tell us your preference, for example if
                you are unconscious, we may go ahead and share your information
                if we believe it is in your best interest. We may also share
                your information when needed to lessen a serious and imminent
                threat to health or safety.
              </p>
              <p>
