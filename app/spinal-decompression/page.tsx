          "Spinal decompression is a non-invasive mechanical procedure performed within our office to help alleviate back pain. It involves gently stretching the spine to take pressure off the spinal discs — the cushions that separate the vertebrae in the spine.",
          "By relieving this pressure, bulging discs can retract back into place, which takes pressure off the nerves in the spine. Decompressing the spine also permits water, oxygen and other fluids to work their way back into the discs, allowing them to heal naturally.",
          "Spinal decompression is an excellent option for anyone with chronic back pain who wants to get back to living a pain-free life as quickly as possible.",
